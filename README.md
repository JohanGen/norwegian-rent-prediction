Start the app with "streamlit run streamlit_app_dp.py".
Choose the option "Trene alle modeller på nytt".
Clear the cache with "Tøm cache og last modeller på nytt".
You should now be able to interact with the two models and see the results (R2 metrics).

It should be pretty straight forward, but try installing the requirements if something is missing or an error is persisting.
